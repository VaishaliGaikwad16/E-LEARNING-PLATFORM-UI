ABOUT E-LEARNING-PLATFORM
The E-Learning Platform UI is a multi-page front-end web project designed using HTML and CSS. The goal of this project is to create an attractive, interactive, and user-friendly interface for an online learning platform. This UI helps users browse available courses, watch educational videos, and track their learning progress. It is built as part of the CodTech Internship Task 4.

The platform consists of four main pages:

Home Page (index.html)
This is the first page users see. It includes a welcome message and a brief introduction to the platform. A stylish button labeled “Explore Courses” encourages users to go to the Courses page. The design is clean and centered, using a large heading, subtext, and a smooth background.

Courses Page (courses.html)
This page displays a list of available courses. Each course is shown in a card layout with a title, description, and a “Start Learning” button. The layout is responsive and adjusts nicely for all screen sizes. CSS hover effects and shadows make each course card visually appealing and interactive.

Course Detail Page (course-detail.html)
When a user clicks on a course, they are taken to this page. Here, a video is embedded from YouTube to demonstrate course content. A brief explanation of the course is given below the video. There is also a progress bar that visually shows how much of the course has been completed (e.g., 40%). The design uses gradients, rounded edges, and shadows for a modern look.

Dashboard Page (dashboard.html)
This page helps users keep track of their learning progress. For each enrolled course, a progress bar is displayed showing how much they have completed (e.g., HTML & CSS – 40%, JavaScript – 20%). This feature makes the UI more engaging and helps users stay motivated.

From a design perspective, the UI uses a modern and professional style. It includes:

A sticky navigation bar with smooth hover effects

Rounded cards and buttons

Gradient backgrounds and responsive layout

Consistent color schemes (blue, green, and white tones)

The interface is designed to be fully responsive, meaning it works well on both desktops and mobile devices. All the sections are centered, and the layout adjusts according to screen size, ensuring a good user experience.

Although this UI does not have backend functionality, it presents a solid structure that can be later connected with databases, login systems, and video tracking tools. It is a great example of how front-end technologies like HTML and CSS can be used to build a professional educational platform layout.

In conclusion, this E-Learning Platform UI demonstrates the use of modern web design practices. It effectively shows course content, video lessons, and progress tracking in an attractive way, fulfilling the task requirements for the internship.
